## 📘 Course Overview

The **B9AI101 NLP** module introduces fundamental techniques and tools used in Natural Language Processing, including:

- Text preprocessing and tokenization
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging
- Text classification
- Topic modeling
- Sentiment analysis
- Vector space models (TF-IDF, word embeddings)
- Language models

## 🔍 Key Topics Covered

### ✔️ Preprocessing
- Lowercasing, punctuation removal
- Stopword filtering
- Lemmatization and stemming

### ✔️ Tokenization
- Sentence and word tokenization using `nltk` and `spaCy`

### ✔️ Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
- Using `spaCy` for syntactic role tagging

### ✔️ Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Identifying people, organizations, places from text

### ✔️ Text Classification
- Simple classifiers using Scikit-learn (Naive Bayes, SVM)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF

### ✔️ Topic Modeling
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

### ✔️ Sentiment Analysis
- Using rule-based models like VADER
- Evaluating classifier performance
